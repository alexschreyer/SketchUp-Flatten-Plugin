Description :   Allows the user to do two things:
                1)  Lay an arbitrarily-oriented face or collection of coplanar faces flat
                    on the ground. Use in combination with a manual unfold tool to flatten shapes first.
                2)  Unwrap non-coplanar faces using an automatic (random) algorithm and then
                    lay the resulting set of faces flat on the ground.
                This helps in producing cutouts, as CNC-prep, for texturing, etc.
